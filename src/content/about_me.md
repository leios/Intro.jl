# About the Author

I am Dr. James Schloss.
I received my PhD in 2019 from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST).
While there, I studied quantum systems by simulating them with my Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).
During that time, my roommate (who will remain unnamed) became a core developer of the Julia language.
So I tried it out and was (admittedly) a little lukewarm about the language.
Throughout the next few years, the language evolved and Julia slowly became more and more important in my daily life.
It started as a Python Replacement.
Then a C replacement.
Eventually, it even became a replacement for CUDA (the interface I was using to do almost all of my research).
Since then, I have been working off and on in the Julia Lab at MIT (a very prominent research arm of the Julia programming language), where I have worked on various scientific computing projects such as climate and molecular simulations.

I also run the (relatively) popular youtube channel and twitch stream Leios Labs, where we have been developing a book for uncommon algorithms known as the *Arcane Algorithm Archive*.
Some of the chapters in this book were inspired by that work.
I have also worked with Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) on several projects, including the Summer of Math Exposition, where we encouraged thousands of online content creators to make more math content online.

I have always said, "Your research is only as good as your ability to communicate it."

This book is my attempt to provide core elements of my research and the language I typically use to do that research for everyone to read and learn from.


# Prominent Reviewers

Any academic work is only as good as the peers who read and critique it.
For that reason, I intend to keep a list of "Prominent Reviewers" who don't mind putting their name in this section.
This should be a list of academics or core community members who have either been asked to review the work due to their expertise or have contributed significantly in the beta reading phase.
