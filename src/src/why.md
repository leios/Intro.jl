# Why Julia?

It is worth spending a few minutes discussing Julia *in comparison to other languages*.
After all, there are hundreds of languages that are all great at certain things.
Web developers have completely different skill sets than research software engineers, who are still quite different than systems engineers.
Java is not C, and neither are Python.
Each language has it's own niche and purpose and it's sometimes difficult to decide which language will fit your own project best.

So, why would you use Julia over other languages?

That's actually a really good question.
