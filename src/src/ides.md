# Julia Development Environments

When learning to program for the first time, the hardes part is often times the very first step -- just getting the code to run on your computer in the first palce!
Though Julia does it's best to make this part of the process as straightforward as possible, it can still be a little challenging depending on what type of environment you want to set up.
For this chapter, we will be starting with the basic shell (downloadable from the [website](ADD LINK)), and then talking about different programming environments in order of complexity (at least in my opinion):
1. Basic text editing
2. Pluto notebooks
3. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

While reading this, please keep in mind what I mentioned in the introduction: simplicity and ease of use are inversely proportional.
Even though full development environments are more difficult to set up, they provide great tooling that is hard to mimic with other development environments.

With that said, I almost always just use the simplest tool available to me unless I need something more complex.
Also: I just love vi(m).
