# Who is Julia?

Ok, look. If you are reading this book, you *hopefully* have realized by now that Julia is not a person, but instead a dynamic programming language full of unique and interesting features.
However, I think every single Julia programmer has gotten the question, "Who is Julia?" by some cheeky student.
Even Google used to get this confused.
Back in the day when you searched for Julia lang (short for Julia language), you would get results for the Julia language as you might have hoped for, but you would also get the results of a rather popular woman named Julia Lang.

But let's stop talking about the "who" and start with the "what".
How do we actually answer the question of "What is Julia?"
It is surprisingly tricky to answer.

Many Julia programmers choose to say that "Julia is a high-performant language focused on usability. It is (in principle) just as easy to use as Python, but as fast as C.
It is succinct and gets the point across, but is it accurate?

Other people claim that Julia is a straight-up solution to the "two language problem" where data scientists often write their code in an easy language like Python or Matlab, which end up calling libraries ultimately written in a more performant language like C.
Because Julia is both performant and easy to use, there is no longer a need for two separate languages when one could do.

# A Note on Julia's performance

At this point in the story, it is worth discussion Julia's overall performance -- in particular, how it compares to many other programming languages like C, python, or matlab.
The fact is that this is a bit of a mixed bag.




...

Basically, as long as you write your code in a function and make sure not to pull any variables from the global scope, you can be sure Julia will be relatively fast
# Just things to keep in mind

## Scoping of variables

Don't use variables out of their scope
