To be honest, this is only partially true. I know many programmers who do their best work around or after midnight; however, programming (at least nowadays) is anything but solitary.</p><p>Code is almost always written with a team and for many different purposes. It could be that you are writing a research paper with collegues and need to test some hypothesis. It could be that you want to write software that can be used by many other people for any sort of purpose. It could be that you are just hobby programming with friends. No matter the case, it&#39;s important to write code that can be tested and produces the same result on any computer. Nowadays, modern open source tooling makes it much easier to write such code and collaborate with other developers from around the world. The problem is that most programming languages were developed without care for such tooling.</p><p>Here, Julia is different. It was built with collaboration in mind and actively encourages the development of <em>packages</em> that integrate with it&#39;s package manager, which is a core component of the language and easily usable through the REPL. These packages are easy to create and make it easy for anyone else to reproduce and test code on their local machines. The package manager can also easily connect to version control systems like git and most packages are available on github. To be honest, I might argue that package management is one of the most important parts of the Julia language.</p><p>This is why I put this chapter <em>before</em> the chapter on Julia syntax. Package management is so fundamental to Julia that it&#39;s hard to write anything at all without using it in some capacity. That said, this chapter will cover a lot more than just the basics, so it&#39;s important for you to go at your own pace. Remember that this is a book. You choose how you want to read it.</p><p>If you want to cover Julia syntax first, please skip or skim this chapter and come back when you are ready. If you want to learn everything now, then go right ahead!</p><p>Take your time and enjoy the process.</p><h2 id="What-is-package-management?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-is-package-management?">What is package management?</a><a id="What-is-package-management?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-is-package-management?" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Let&#39;s say you want to install software. What do you do?</p><p>Well, on Windows, you often google the software you want to install, click on the appropriate link, and then click the &quot;download&quot; button on the website (all while hoping and proaying you are not accidentally installing the wrong software – or worse: a virus). On Mac and IOS, you probably first try to see if the application is available on the App Store and then download it from there. On Android, you use the Google Play Store. On Linux, you interact with your package manager.</p><p>All of these are examples of package management. The idea is simple: there is a software package somewhere online that the user wants to download to their own computer. Someone or something needs to manage the package. In the case of Windows, it is done by the user, themself. On other devices, there is some software in the middle to do this instead.</p><p>So what does this have to do with Julia?</p><p>Well, the best software developers I know actively try to write as little code as possible. Why? Because it is fundamentally better to rely on other people who are already solving the same problem.</p><p>Let&#39;s say you want to do a ...`</p><p>In this case, you <em>could</em> write the algorithm yourself, but that&#39;s a lot of work. It&#39;s fundamentlly easier to download a package from online that does the same thing. More than that, the package you find online will probably be faster than whatever you were going to write because, well, you are probably learning about the algorithm for the first time while the package developer is (hopefully) an expert on the topic.</p><h2 id="Installing-Packages"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Installing-Packages">Installing Packages</a><a id="Installing-Packages-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Installing-Packages" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>First things first, let&#39;s discuss how to install and use packages. If you are working from the REPL, first enter package mode by pressing <code>]</code>. From there, your command prompt should turn blue and look like this:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(@v1.X) pkg&gt;</code></pre><p>From here, you can add (install) an package you want with:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(@v1.X) pkg&gt; add Pkg</code></pre><p>So (for example), if you want to plot some data, you might do:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(@v1.X) pkg&gt; add Plots</code></pre><p>Note that the Plots package is <em>technically</em> Plots.<em>jl</em>, but the <em>.jl</em> extension is removed by the package manager.</p><p>Once the package is loaded, press backspace to enter the regular REPL so your command prompt is green and looks like this:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">julia&gt;</code></pre><p>Now you can use the package locally with:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">julia&gt; using Plots</code></pre><p>This will take a second to download all of Plots&#39;s dependencies as well, but after that, you can use any function exported by Plots directly in your REPL. You can also use the same syntax in any file for your own package(s). If you want to use a non-exported function you can do so by calling <code>Plots.fx</code> where <code>fx</code> should be replaced by the function you want. Note that there is some nuance to this that we will talk about with modules later.</p><p>Finally, if you want to remove <code>Plots</code>, just use the <code>rm</code> or <code>remove</code> command like so:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(@v1.X) pkg&gt; rm Plots</code></pre><p>or</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(@v1.X) pkg&gt; remove Plots</code></pre><p>Note that if you do not want to use the REPL to do this any of this, you can do so by first <code>using Pkg</code> and then doing all the commands in the package mode of the REPL with the <code>Pkg</code> package. For the Plots example above, this might look like:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">using Pkg
Pkg.add(&quot;Plots&quot;)
using Plots</code></pre><p>Also keep in mind that this particular version of <code>Plots.jl</code> will be pulled from a giant repository of all available Julia packages called a <code>Registry</code>.[^In particular <em>the</em> Julia Registry here: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General] We&#39;ll talk more about that in a bit as well.</p><p>But wait. What if your friend wants to run your code, but forgot to install Plots first? Well, in that case, Julia will show an error message like so:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">ADD  ERROR V 1.9</code></pre><p>It will then prompt your friend to install the appropriate package.</p><p>But there&#39;s actually another way to make sure your friend is using not only the right packages, but the right package versions as well, and that&#39;s by creating your own package and sending that instead. Each package is generally specified as a <code>project</code> and the next few sections will talk about them in detail.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-project?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-is-a-project?">What is a project?</a><a id="What-is-a-project?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-is-a-project?" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>A <code>project</code> in Julia is anything set of coding scripts you are working on that need to work cohesively together. The specific set of packages you need to get your code to run is available in the <code>Project.toml</code> file, which will be in the root (home) directory of your codebase.</p><p>So let&#39;s see this in action. First, let&#39;s generate a new package from the REPL by first pressing the <code>]</code> key:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(@v1.X) pkg&gt; generate NewPackage.jl
  Generating  project NewPackage:
    NewPackage.jl/Project.toml
    NewPackage.jl/src/NewPackage.jl</code></pre><p>Here, we see that a new directory has been created with the name <code>NewPackage.jl</code> along with a <code>Project.toml</code> file and a new directory and file <code>src/NewPackage.jl</code> Note that the <code>.jl</code> extension is not strictly necessary, but is common practice for julia package development. At least for me, I typically use the <code>.jl</code> extension if I am writing code meant to be used by other people, but leave it off for my own scripts that are not intended for public use.</p><p>Now let&#39;s look into each file, starting with <code>Project.toml</code>:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">cat NewPackage.jl/Project.toml 
name = &quot;NewPackage&quot;
uuid = &quot;6c3339cd-44b7-4b24-89b3-44aad60a1695&quot;
authors = [&quot;James Schloss &lt;jrs.schloss@gmail.com&gt;&quot;]
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;</code></pre><p>Ok, lot&#39;s to talk about:</p><ol><li><code>cat</code> is a terminal command that just shows the content of a file. Don&#39;t worry about it too much, I just showed the command for clarity.</li><li><code>name</code> is the name you provided for the package. Note that the <code>.jl</code> extension is stripped in the actual package name.</li><li>The <code>uuid</code> is a &quot;Universally Unique Identifier&quot; and will be different for each person. <code>uuid</code> values are used a bunch throughout different areas of software engineering, but here they are used to differentiate packages, that way if two packages have the same name, they can still be uniquely identified [^ Note that there are some caveats here that we will talk about when discussing registering a package].</li><li><code>authors</code> are the authors in the format typically used for git (and specifically github). Feel free to add new authors to this as necessary. And yes, that is my actual email. Feel free to send me a message if you want!</li><li><code>version</code> is the version for your package and is set to <code>0.1.0</code> by default. This will be discussed in it&#39;s own section below.</li></ol><p>Now let&#39;s see what&#39;s in the other new file:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">cat NewPackage.jl/src/NewPackage.jl 
module NewPackage

greet() = print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)

end # module</code></pre><p>This is actually just a julia file with a basic &quot;Hello World!&quot; script. There is not too much to say except that it is creating a <code>module</code> with a single component, the <code>greet()</code> function. So how do we call this function?</p><p>The simplest way is to just <code>include</code> the file directly into the Julia REPL:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">julia&gt; include(&quot;NewPackage.jl/src/NewPackage.jl&quot;)
Main.NewPackage
julia&gt; NewPackage.greet()
Hello World!</code></pre><p>The second way is to start Julia up <em>with this specific project</em> so we can use it like any other package:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">cd NewPackage.jl/
julia --project
julia&gt; using NewPackage
[ Info: Precompiling NewPackage [6c3339cd-44b7-4b24-89b3-44aad60a1695]

julia&gt; NewPackage.greet()
Hello World!</code></pre><p>A couple things to note:</p><ol><li>In the first method (just <code>include</code>ing the file, we are treating the package as a single file and otherwise using whatever packages we already have installed on our system.</li><li>In the second method, we are launching julia with the <code>--project</code> flag, which uses the packages in the <code>Project.toml</code> file. Right now, that file has no dependencies, but we&#39;ll talk about that in a second. To use this flag, you must specify <em>where the project is located</em>, which is in the current directory by default, but you could also use <code>julia --project=/path/to/Project.toml</code>.</li><li>When <code>using NewPackage</code>, there is a small delay where Julia precompiles not only the package, itself, but also any other necessary packages and functions.</li><li>Finally, to call the <code>greet()</code> function, we need to call it from the module with <code>NewPackage.greet()</code>.</li></ol><h3 id="Adding-packages-to-your-Project.toml"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Adding-packages-to-your-Project.toml">Adding packages to your <code>Project.toml</code></a><a id="Adding-packages-to-your-Project.toml-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Adding-packages-to-your-Project.toml" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Ok, let&#39;s keep going within the project that we created before (with <code>julia --project</code>). What if our package needs some other package to work properly, how might we do this?</p><p>Well let&#39;s start by pressing <code>]</code> in the REPL. Now you should see this:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(NewPackage) pkg&gt;</code></pre><p>Immediately there is a subtle, but important difference: The <code>pkg&gt;</code> prompt has <code>(NewPackage)</code> in parenthesis before it. This means that the package manager will be directly modifying <code>NewPackage.jl</code>&#39;s <code>Project.toml</code>, but keep everything else clean. So now let&#39;s att <code>Plots</code> like before:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(NewPackage) pkg&gt; add Plots

More specifically, if I were to give a friend this Julia project, how can I be sure that they can install the right packages?</p><p>Well, the changes will be reflected in the <code>Project.toml</code> file:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">cat Project.toml 
name = &quot;NewPackage&quot;
uuid = &quot;6c3339cd-44b7-4b24-89b3-44aad60a1695&quot;

Plots = &quot;91a5bcdd-55d7-5caf-9e0b-520d859cae80&quot;
</code></pre><p>As you can see, there is now a new section called <code>[deps]</code> which lists out all of the &quot;dependencies&quot; (software necessary for the project to run. In general, as long as you pass the <code>Project.toml</code> file along with the rest of the code, people can install all the necessary packages by doing:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">julia --project=.
] # to enter package mode in the REPL
(NewPackage) pkg&gt; instantiate</code></pre><p>where <code>instantiate</code> is the command used to create a working instance of the project by installing all the necessary software.</p><h4 id="What-about-the-Manifest.toml?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-about-the-Manifest.toml?">What about the <code>Manifest.toml</code>?</a><a id="What-about-the-Manifest.toml?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-about-the-Manifest.toml?" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Note: CHECK FOR V1.9!!!</p><p>Now let&#39;s touch on the other file, the <code>Manifest.toml</code>. When we used the <code>add Plots</code> command, Julia installed not only <code>Plots</code>, but also all the other necessary software for <code>Plots</code> to run, including several non-Julia blobs known as artifacts. From the user&#39;s perspective, the only piece of software they care about is <code>Plots</code>, but it would be helpful to keep track of all these other bits and bobs. That&#39;s where the <code>Manifest.toml</code> file comes in. It&#39;s just a list of every package and all of their dependencies.</p><p>In short, the <code>Project.toml</code> file is a user-generated short-list of necessary packages, while the <code>Manifest.toml</code> is a computer generated long-list of everything else. We will not inspect this file too deeply because, well:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">wc Manifest.toml 
  913  2409 31541 Manifest.toml</code></pre><p>The file already has 900 lines of code! For those who don&#39;t know, the <code>wc</code> command stands for <code>wc</code> and will just show how many lines, words, and characters each file has.</p><p>For now, let&#39;s just look at where Plots is specified:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">[[deps.Plots]]

version = &quot;1.39.0&quot;</code></pre><p>Here, we see a short-hand version of the <code>Project.toml</code> for <code>Plots</code>, along with all of it&#39;s dependencies. The <code>deps.Plots</code> notation can be read as &quot;dependencies for <code>Plots</code>.&quot; We can also look into any one of these dependencies in the <code>Manifest.toml</code> file to see how it works on your own machine.</p><p>It&#39;s actually kinda interesting to see what pieces of software <code>Plots</code> and Julia pulls in to get everything working on your own system, so I might recommend just looking at the file in depth for fun. But to be honest, only for fun.</p><p>Otherwise this file is completely computer generated and can probably be ignored. In fact, if you are using git, I would suggest adding the <code>Manifest.toml</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> file so you don&#39;t accidentally commit it.</p><h4 id="What-if-I-don&#39;t-want-to-use-the-REPL?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-if-I-don&#39;t-want-to-use-the-REPL?">What if I don&#39;t want to use the REPL?</a><a id="What-if-I-don&#39;t-want-to-use-the-REPL?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-if-I-don&#39;t-want-to-use-the-REPL?" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>So there are some instances where you don&#39;t have the Julia REPL immediately available (we&#39;ll definitely talk about these instances later). In these cases, you can load the <code>Pkg</code> package and use all the same commands as if you were calling a function from that module. For example:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">using Pkg
Pkg.status()</code></pre><p>Just remember that in this case, the commands will be functions and will take function arguments, so you need to add parentheses (<code>()</code>) and treat any function arguments as Julia data structures (probably strings). So <code>add</code> would look like:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">using Pkg
Pkg.add(&quot;Plots&quot;)</code></pre><h3 id="Wrap-up"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Wrap-up">Wrap-up</a><a id="Wrap-up-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Wrap-up" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Ok, that was a lot. At this stage, we have talked about how to use basic packages and add them to basic projects, but there are lots of little things to talk about. Let&#39;s tackle them one at a time.</p><h2 id="The-status-command"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-status-command">The <code>status</code> command</a><a id="The-status-command-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-status-command" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>In the previous example, we added a new package called <code>Plots</code> to an existing project called <code>NewProject</code>. That&#39;s all well and good, but Julia is an actively developed langauge and packages could change. What if there is an issue with your, specific version of <code>Plots</code> and you want to go back to a previous version? How would you even figure out such a thing?</p><p>Well, you can do so by looking at your <code>status</code> or <code>st</code>:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(NewPackage) pkg&gt; st
     Project NewPackage v0.1.0
      Status `~/projects/stuff/NewPackage.jl/Project.toml`
  [91a5bcdd] Plots v1.39.0</code></pre><p>Here, it shows that we are using <code>NewPackage v0.1.0</code> and <code>Plots v1.39.0</code>, as specified in our <code>Project.toml</code> Now that we know our package versions we can play around with them.</p><p>!!! note On semantic versioning     Julia uses Semantic Versioning, which means that there are 3 numbers associated with each version one for major changes, minor changes, and patches.     For example, v1.2.3 would be on major version 1, minor version 2, and patch version 3.     These version numbers are incredibly useful for ensuring that results from code can be replicated by other users.     After all, two users could get radically different results if there were radical changes between package versions.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">By standardizing on semantic versioning, Julia can ensure the package manager can maintain a clear concept of which packages depend on each other and which versions of those packages are necessary to provide correct results.
So for example, let&#39;s say that package A requires package B to be at v1.3.4 or older.
If you install package A, the package manager will automatically lower the version of package B to 1.3.4 or older.</code></pre><h3 id="Lowering-the-package-version"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Lowering-the-package-version">Lowering the package version</a><a id="Lowering-the-package-version-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Lowering-the-package-version" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Following the discussion from above, let&#39;s say we want to lower the version of <code>Plots</code> for our <code>NewPackage</code>. This is as simple as:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">] # to enter package mode in the REPL
(NewPackage) pkg&gt; add Plots#v1.38.0</code></pre><p>It is exactly the same as the previous <code>add</code> command, but with a <code>#v1.38.0</code> added to it. You can put down any version number you like instead.</p><p>But for now, I want to take a look at the output:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">     Cloning git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl.git`

  9 dependencies successfully precompiled in 96 seconds (128 already precompiled)</code></pre><p>My point here is that downgrading a package is easy syntactically (it&#39;s just an <code>add</code> command), but there is a lot going on behind the scenes. In fact, it&#39;s relatively easy to use any development branch of any package. Let&#39;s show that off next.</p><h3 id="Using-a-specific-git-branch"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Using-a-specific-git-branch">Using a specific git branch</a><a id="Using-a-specific-git-branch-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Using-a-specific-git-branch" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>So let&#39;s imagine there is some new feature to the <code>Plots</code> package that you really want to use immediately. Unfortunately, this feature is only in the primary development branch (usually either <code>master</code> or <code>main</code>). What do you do?</p><p>Well, you can just <code>add</code> it like so:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(NewPackage) pkg&gt; add Plots#master</code></pre><p>This will do the same procedure as before and update your local files so that they point to the master branch. In fact, you could do this same thing for any commit hash or branch, not just <code>master</code> or <code>main</code>.</p><p>But what if your friend made their own version of Plots and really wants to use that instead? Ok, no problem, just use the url:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(NewPackage) pkg&gt; add https://github.com/Friend/Plots.jl</code></pre><p>Here, you would need to replace the link with whatever link your friend has been using for development. If it&#39;s on github, you can probably just replace <code>Friend</code> with your friend&#39;s github ID.</p><p>This leads us to the next topic, developing local packages.</p><h3 id="Using-packages-outside-of-the-Julia-Registry"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Using-packages-outside-of-the-Julia-Registry">Using packages outside of the Julia Registry</a><a id="Using-packages-outside-of-the-Julia-Registry-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Using-packages-outside-of-the-Julia-Registry" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>If you have decided to create a project for yourself, you will probably be storing that project in some git repository somewhere. Though at some point you might want to put the package in the official Julia registry, there is no real requirement to do so. In fact, there are a bunch of packages that exist outside of the official Julia registry for some reason or another. to use one of these packages, just do what we did above and add the project with the development url:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(NewPackage) pkg&gt; add URL</code></pre><h3 id="Developing-local-packages"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Developing-local-packages">Developing local packages</a><a id="Developing-local-packages-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Developing-local-packages" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Ok, but what if you want to make changes to <code>Plots</code>, how would you do that? One easy way is to download the repo onto your own machine and do development on your own fork (before creating a pull request with the changes to the official repository).</p><p>So let&#39;s show off how to do that (starting from the <code>NewPackage.jl</code> source / root directory)</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">cd ../
git clone git clone </code></pre><p>This will get a version of <code>Plots.jl</code> on your local computer. Feel free to do whatever you want to it. Note that you could also have used the ssh or git link as well (<code>git@github.com:JuliaPlots/Plots.jl.git</code>).</p><p>Once this is done, we can go back to the <code>NewPackage.jl</code> directory and enter the Julia project:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">cd NewPackage.jl
julia --project=.</code></pre><p>Now we need to tell Julia that we will be developing <code>Plots</code> locally with the <code>dev</code> command:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">] # to enter package mode in the REPL
(NewPackage) pkg&gt; dev ../Plots.jl/</code></pre><p>Now let&#39;s take a look at our <code>status</code></p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">(NewPackage) pkg&gt; st
